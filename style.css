Step-by-step instructions
Create an HTML file (e.g., index.html) with standard structure including <head> and <body> sections.
Inside the <head> section, link an external CSS file using:
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
This assumes your CSS file is named styles.css and is in the same folder.
Create the styles.css file in the same directory as your HTML file.
Start writing CSS rules in styles.css. Each rule has a selector, property, and value:
Example:
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}

This targets all <p> elements and makes text blue and 16 pixels in size.
Use class selectors (with .) to style specific groups:
In HTML: <p class="highlight">Text</p>
In CSS:
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

Use ID selectors (with #) for unique elements:
In HTML: <div id="header">Welcome</div>
In CSS:
#header {
  font-size: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}

Organize your CSS file from general to specific:
Reset or base styles (e.g., body, h1, p)
Layout (e.g., header, navigation, main content)
Components or sections
Utility classes (e.g., .hidden, .center)
Save both files and open index.html in a browser to see changes.
Use comments in CSS (/* comment */) /*to label sections for clarity.
Test responsiveness by resizing the browser or using developer tools.*/
